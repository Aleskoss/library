# library
In this project I will showcase my skills using objects, especially object prototypes and prototypal inheritence 
1. Loop through library array and display books on the site in the table, display each book object property in a seperate table cell
2. create delete button, if id on button equals id of book, remove book from array with splice
3. delete elements from table on page load and every new book add and load new table contents

This project might look unfinished, but for now i have showcased all skills I needed and will probably come back to this project later
